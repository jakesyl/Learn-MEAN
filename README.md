Definitions:

* A Walking Skeleton is a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small end-to-end function.  It need not use the final architecture, but it should link together the main architectural components.  The architecture and the functionality can then evolve in parallel

Commands:

* npm init
* npm install nodemon -g 
* npm install --save express jade
* npm install bower
* bower init
* bower install jquery --save
* bower install toastr --save
* bower install angular angular-resource angular-route --save
* nodemon 
Notes:
* --save-dev makes it non-global in scope when using npm
